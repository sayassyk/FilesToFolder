# FilesToFolder
A simple windows application to seggregate image files to folders.
The intention of this app is to move different images of same group to single folders. 

**How it works:**

Place and execute the released .exe file in any folder which contains a lot of images, then all the images of same group will be moved to the corresponding folders which named as each group of images names.

Same group images should start with same name and separated with any other numbers or texts followed by "_" or "." or "-" .
The folders will be created with the starting name of each image group.

Eg: 
  A folder contains the following files named: 
  
    ABC_14.jpg, 
    ABC-2we.jpg, 
    ABC_de3.jpg, 
    XYZ-1q.jpg,
    XYZ.x3.jpg, 
    XYZ_q0.jpg

When we executing our .exe in this folder, 2 folders will be created as "ABC" and "XYZ".

Then first 3 files (starting with "ABC") will be moved to the folder "ABC" and the other 3 (starting with "XYZ") will be moved to the folder "XYZ"

As simple as that! :)
